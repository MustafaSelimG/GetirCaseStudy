### ● You are testing the Getir app. When you find a bug in production, how do you manage the process? 
First thing I will do is reproduce the bug and I will write down how I reproduce the bug step by step. I will create a bug report and note as much information as possible (screenshot, screenrecord, platform information, operating system, bug severity & priority etc.). After I give the bug information I will try to understand what cause the bug and check all the steps.

### ● Onboarding screen will be tested on Getir app. What kind of test plan do you create?


### ● What are the latest technological topics you researched?

### ● How to use the testing pyramid?
