### ● You are testing the Getir app. When you find a bug in production, how do you manage the process? 
First thing I will do is reproduce the bug and I will write down how I reproduce the bug step by step. I will create a bug report and note as much information as possible (screenshot, screenrecord, platform information, operating system, bug severity & priority etc.). After I give the bug information I will try to understand what cause the bug and check all the steps.

### ● Onboarding screen will be tested on Getir app. What kind of test plan do you create?
I will analyze the onboarding page, check elements and page structure for the tests I will write first. I decide which environments will be tested, API and UI tests can be performed for this example. Then the types of tests can be considered. The tests are tested as a whole after piece by piece. Then functional tests, load and stress tests can be performed. After the cases are documented, test environments are prepared and planning is made and estimated periods are determined. When the tests are completed, they are documented and presented with bug reports.

### ● What are the latest technological topics you researched?
I am following recent technologies updates with Postman, Selenium and Rest Assured. I am reading articles about what's the difference with latest updates.
As a software language I am following up Java, Python and C# recent releases.

### ● How to use the testing pyramid?
The test pyramid starts with unit tests and continues with integration tests between units at a higher level. There are accepting tests as the highest level. Although our tests are certain tests on a small scale, we can start tests as a piece, then perform tests between these parts and continue by testing the whole.
